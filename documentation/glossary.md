## ILS
*abbr. of* Instrument Landing System

A radio antenna at the end of the runway, known as a ''localizer'', guides pilots down onto the runway for landing, via an instrument known as a *guide scope*.

## Fix

A pre-defined point that describes an aircraft's current position. A fix can be an airport (`EGKK`), a waypoint (`WILLO`), or other points, such as a VOR station (`GWC`).

## Waypoint

A fix that is used to aid in navigation, defined in a flight plan or route. Waypoints are assigned a 5-letter code, such as `WILLO` and `ABTUM`.

## Flight Level
*abbr.* FL

A plane's altitude, in 100s of feet. For example, a plane at `FL350` is flying at 35,000ft.

## SID
*abbr. of* Standard Instrument Departure

A route that an aircraft will follow to exit the airport's radar control area. Each SID begins at the airport and terminates at a fix, with waypoints in between.

## STAR
*abbr. of* Standard Terminal Arrival Route

A route that an aircraft will follow to approach the airport, the inverse of a SID.
