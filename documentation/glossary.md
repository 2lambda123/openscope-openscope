# Glossary of aviation terms
*Openscope uses some terms specific to aviation, this glossary attempts to define them.*
---
## ILS
*abbr. of* Instrument Landing System

A radio antenna at the end of the runway, known as a ''localizer'', guides pilots down onto the runway for landing, via an instrument known as a *guide scope*.

## Fix

A pre-defined point that describes an aircraft's current position. A fix can be an airport (`EGKK`), a waypoint (`WILLO`), or other points, such as a VOR station (`GWC`).

## Waypoint

A fix that is used to aid in navigation, defined in a flight plan or route. Waypoints are assigned a 5-letter code, such as `WILLO` and `ABTUM`.

## Flight Level
*abbr.* FL

A plane's altitude, in 100s of feet. For example, a plane at `FL350` is flying at 35,000ft.

## SID
*abbr. of* Standard Instrument Departure

A route that an aircraft will follow to exit the airport's radar control area. Each SID begins at the airport and terminates at a fix, with waypoints in between.

## STAR
*abbr. of* Standard Terminal Arrival Route

A route that an aircraft will follow to approach the airport, the inverse of a SID.

## Airspace

A pre-defined three-dimensional area where certain restrictions occur. For example, in Class A airspace, VFR aircraft are not permitted.

## VFR
*abbr. of* Visual Flight Rules

VFR aircraft do not have instruments enabling them to navigate and land under ILS. As such, they rely on visual clues and ATC instruction to navigate and land.

## IFR
*abbr. of* Instrument Flight Rules

IFR aircraft **do** have instruments allowing them to navigate and land using ILS. IFR aircraft have flight plans that direct them to waypoints.

## Route

A set of waypoints that form a path to the destination. In openScope, the route is changed with the `route` and `reroute` commands.

## Crosswind

Wind blowing at an aircraft from the side. For example, for an aircraft flying north, crosswind is wind blowing west to east or vice versa. This can create dangerous landing conditions.

## Tailwind

Wind blowing at an aircraft from the tail. In a north-flying aircraft, this is wind from south to north.
