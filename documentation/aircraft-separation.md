# Aircraft separation

## General Separation

While in flight if there is not a more specific rule which applies
then aircraft must be separated by at least 3nm laterally or 1000 feet
vertically.

A notice will occur for aircraft which do not have sufficient vertical
separation and are within 4nm laterally.

Collisions occur when an aircraft is within approximately 160 feet of
another aircraft.

## Head-on use of runway

A warning will be issued if two aircraft within 6 miles of each other
are assigned to the same runway but have opposite headings.

## Reduced lateral separation during runway approach

Standard vertical separation may be applied if the specified lateral
separation isn't maintained.

### Same runway

Two aircraft which have both captured the runway localizer must remain
at least 2.5nm from each other.  A notice occurs at 2.8nm.

### Different runways

Two aircraft which have both captured the localizer of their
respective runway must remain 3000 feet apart, a notice will occur at
3500 feet.
