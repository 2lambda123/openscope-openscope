### About Gatwick Airport (LGW | EGKK)
*Gatwick airport*, also known as *London Gatwick*, is a major international airport located in *Crawley, West Sussex*.  
*London Gatwick* is the second-busiest airport in the United Kingdom as well as the eighth-busiest airport in the world. The airport had also been holding the record as the world's busiest airport with only one operational runway at a time until 2017 when *Mumbai airport* overtook this record.

#### Statistics
* **Total passengers**: *46,075,400* (2018)
* **Aircraft movements**: *283,926* (2018)
* **Cargo**: *112,676 tonnes* (2018)


### Airspace
In openscope, the airspace responsible for *Gatwick airport* is a combination of multiple sectors in reality (see "*Sectors Available in OpenScope*" for reference).  
It encompasses large parts of the *London Terminal Control Area*, mainly to the south as the northern sectors are mainly used for traffic to and from *London Heathrow*, *London Luton* and *London Stansted*. The airspace extends from the surface up to FL195.


### Runways
| Runway | Length (m) | (ft)   | Surface |   
|:------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------:|  
|08L/26R |2,565       |8,415   |Asphalt  |
|08R/26L |3,316       |10,879  |Asphalt  |

*Gatwick* is using single-runway operations although it has two parallel runways. The close proximity of the two runways (only 200m/656ft apart) is insufficient for simultaneous runway operations and therefore only the southern runway (08R/26L) is used for departures and landings during normal operations while the northern runway (08L/26R) is used as a taxiway and can only be used when the southern runway is out of use for any reason.

**In openscope, westerly operations (26L for departures/landings) are used which is also the main runway direction at Gatwick (74% of the time in use)**

In the future *London Gatwick* might "bring its existing standby runway into routine use". One scenario would see 08L/26R used for departing narrow-body aircraft only, while the longer 08R/26L would be used for wide-body take-offs and all landings. In longer term the airport remains interested in constructing a new runway to the south.

### Instrument Procedures
*Gatwick Airport* has a large quantity of SIDs and STARs, RNAV and, typical for airports in the United Kingdom, many non-RNAV procedures. Aircraft performing flights under Instrument Flight Rules usually prefer to use RNAV procedures eventhough at *Gatwick* some procedures are only available as non-RNAV procedures (for instance STARs from the northwest).
