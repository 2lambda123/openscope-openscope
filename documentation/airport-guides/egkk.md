### 1. About Gatwick Airport (LGW | EGKK)
*Gatwick airport*, also known as *London Gatwick*, is a major international airport located in *Crawley, West Sussex*, 47.5km south of Central London.  
*London Gatwick* is the second-busiest airport in the United Kingdom as well as the eighth-busiest airport in the world. The airport had also been holding the record as the world's busiest airport with only one operational runway at a time until 2017 when *Mumbai airport* overtook this record.  
  
  
#### 1.1 Statistics
* **Total passengers**: *46,576,473* (2019)
* **Aircraft movements**: *284,987* (2019)
* **Cargo**: *110,358 tonnes* (2019)
  
  
### 2. Airspace
In openScope, the airspace responsible for *Gatwick airport* is a combination of multiple sectors in reality. It encompasses large parts of the *London Terminal Control Area*, mainly to the south as the northern sectors are mainly used for traffic to and from *London Heathrow*, *London Luton* and *London Stansted*. The airspace extends from the surface up to maximum FL195, depending on the airspace section (see "Airspace Depiction"-view in openScope).  
  
#### 2.1 Sectors available in openScope
The sim features a combination of these sectors:  

| Sector                         |  Frequency  |             |             |
|--------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Gatwick Director               | 126.825 MHz | 118.950 MHz | 129.025 MHz |
| London Terminal Control OCKHAM | 134.125 MHz |             |             |
| London Terminal Control WILLO  | 133.180 MHz |             |             |
| London Terminal Control BIGGIN | 120.530 MHz |             |             |

### 3. Runways
| Runway | Length (m) | (ft)   | Surface |
|:------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------:|
|08L/26R |2,565       |8,415   |Asphalt  |
|08R/26L |3,316       |10,879  |Asphalt  |
  
*Gatwick airport* is using single-runway operations although it has two parallel runways. The close distance of the two runways (only 200m/656ft apart) is insufficient for simultaneous runway operations and therefore only the southern runway (08R/26L) is used for departures and landings during normal operations while the northern runway (08L/26R) is used as a taxiway and can only be used when the southern runway is out of use for any reason.  
  
**In openScope, Runway 26L is used for departures and landings, which is also the most common configuration at Gatwick (in use 74% of the time)**  
  
In the future *Gatwick airport* might "bring its existing standby runway into routine use". One scenario would see 08L/26R used for departing narrow-body aircraft only, while the longer 08R/26L would be used for wide-body take-offs and all landings. In longer term the airport remains interested in constructing a new runway to the south.  
  
  
### 4. Instrument Procedures
*Gatwick Airport* has a large number of SIDs and STARs, including both RNAV and non-RNAV procedures, as common for British airports. IFR flights will normally file for RNAV procedures although some procedures at *Gatwick* are only available as non-RNAV procedures.
