### Vienna Schwechat International Airport
Vienna (Wien) Schwechat International Airport is the largest airport in Austria, serving the Austrian capital Vienna. It is located in the town of Schwechat, 11 miles southeast of Vienna. The airport serves as a base for Austrian Airlines and Eurowings Europe, and is a focus city for Lauda (formerly known as Laudamotion), Anisec Luftfahrt (branded as LEVEL) and Wizz Air.

The Airport was originally built in 1938 as a military design and production complex. There was just one runway (11/29), which was expanded in 1959, and a second runway (16/34) was built in 1972. In 2006 a new control tower was opened which allows for overview of the entire airport.
