### About this facility
Skyguide Air Navigation Center, Dübendorf, Switzerland
269,160 annual operations in 2016

Located at Dübendorf Air Base (close to Zurich), besides the LSAZ FIR, the Skyguide Air Navigation Center is also responsible for the in- and outbound traffic of Switzerlands major airport Zurich (LSZH).

### Airspace
The airspace area extends up to 55nm of distance to the airport and is also covering parts of German national territory. Due to the fact that approaches to runway 14 and 16 require the use of German airspace, these approaches aren't available during the German ordinance period. (MON - FRI: 2100-0700LT; SAT, SUN, holidays;  2000-0700LT). Therefore runway 28 or 34 is usually used for landings then which is reducing the capacity of the airport. Vertically the airspace is covering aircraft up to FL190.

### Instrument Procedures
For outbound traffic LSZH offers a couple of SIDs eventhough usually only DEGES and VEBIT are used. Inbound traffic follows a STAR to either GIPOL or AMIKI. Inbound traffic must be vectored to their final approach course.
